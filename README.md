NSUserDefaults is confusing and weird. This is my attempt to figure out it's behavior using unit tests.

There's only a handful of tests right now. Things tested are:

- persistent domains 
- volatile domains
- simple cross-object synchronization

If there is some behavior you're curious about, feel free to submit a pull request!
